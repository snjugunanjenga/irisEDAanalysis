# Iris Dataset Analysis Project

## Overview
This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in data science featuring measurements of iris flowers from three species: *setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and insights into how the features relate to species classification.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is available for download from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris). The direct link to the dataset file is:  
[**Download Iris Dataset**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data).  
For convenience, a copy of the dataset is also included in the `data/` folder as `iris.csv` (converted to CSV format with headers for ease of use).

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the Iris dataset (`iris.csv`).
- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis (`exploratory_analysis.ipynb`).
- `reports/`: Contains the data story (`data_story.md`) and visualization images.

## How to Run
1. **Prerequisites**: Install Python and the required libraries (`pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `jupyter`). You can use:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib jupyter
