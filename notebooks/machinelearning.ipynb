    "What is SVM?\n",
    "SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It works by finding the optimal boundary (hyperplane) that maximizes the margin between different classes, making it robust for complex datasets.\n",
    "Key Concepts\n",
    "•\tHyperplane: The decision boundary that separates classes.\n",
    "•\tSupport Vectors: Data points closest to the hyperplane, influencing its position.\n",
    "•\tKernels: Functions (e.g., linear, polynomial, RBF) that transform data into higher dimensions for non-linear separation.\n",
